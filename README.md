# Startpage Sanitized

Startpage is a website that serves to replace the default bookmark/most
visited page that a common web browser provides. It is usually hosted
locally so developing it comes down to front end.

This is the sanitized version of my startpage as of June 2020. Its base
features are:
 - aesthetically pleasing design
 - entirely front-end technologies
 - HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery
 - designed to be fast and light
 - responsive layout for mobile use
 - DuckDuckGo search bar
 - random background
 - blurred text boxes
 - agenda of annual events
 - reliable checking for internet connection

> **NOTE:** The demo may load slower due to network speeds, the loading
time is almost nonexistent with disk times.

> **NOTE:** The blur effect may not work properly on some browsers. It
surely does on Firefox.

To customize it for your own use, you must edit most of the source
files and add your own backgrounds and blur them, for better or worse
this requires essential web developing skills. Refer to each file's
commends for instructions.
